Requirements:
Matlab

Running the Code:
To run the code 'cd' into the 'osr_dir', and then type osr_script into the
matlab command interface to run the tests.  The parameters for the tests can be 
accessed at the top of "osr_script.m" around line 17.  The choice to run the 
tests with the learned weights provided by the authors or weights learned from 
the training scheme within this code is available.  Directions for switching 
between the two can be seen at line 107 in "osr_scripts.m"
